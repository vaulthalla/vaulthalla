"""Decide whether a push to main needs the full CI build (#185).

A push to main skips the build when the exact tree it lands was already built and tested:

- a merged pull request whose head has the same tree as the pushed commit (the branch was up to date with main, so
  the PR run tested exactly these files) and a pull_request run of this workflow whose `build` job succeeded on it;
- a `vlr cut` release commit (`chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, the only commit in the push, tagged vX.Y.Z) on top of a
  covered parent, whose diff is purely the version bump: only release.toml's version files change, and every changed
  line is the old version replaced by the new one. release.yml builds the tagged commit. `vlr cut` resumes by
  pushing whatever commit is at HEAD, so a release commit amended with real changes keeps the subject; the content
  check sends it through the full build.

`vlr finalize` commits carry `[skip ci]` (release.toml `finalize_commit_message`), so GitHub never starts this
workflow for them. Direct pushes and anything the gate can't prove run the full build. Any error also runs it: the
gate can only save work, never skip a check it couldn't verify.

Writes `run=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and the reason to the job summary. Standard library only.
