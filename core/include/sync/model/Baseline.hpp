// What both sides of a remote vault file agreed on at its last sync (#187, table sync_file_baseline). A pass under
// the `ask` conflict policy compares each side against it to tell a change on one side (synced normally, in the
// direction of the change) from a change on both sides (a conflict someone has to decide).
//
// Written when a pass sees the two sides agree, and after every successful upload, download, index-only refresh and
// conflict resolution of the file. Each side is compared with its own recorded identity: files.content_hash is a
// hash of the sealed (ciphertext) bytes, so a download re-sealed under a fresh IV has a different hash from the
// object it came from even though the content is the same. The remote side is compared by its index row's content
// hash when it has one (rows Vaulthalla wrote itself, manifests), otherwise by ETag, otherwise by object size: rows
// that come from a LIST, an S3 Inventory or an event notification have no hash, and their size is the stored
// object's size.
