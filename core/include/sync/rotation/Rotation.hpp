// Vault key rotation: the per-file re-encryption protocol, crash recovery and the pass that decides when a rotation
// is finished. Everything here works through injected seams (Deps), so the protocol is tested without a TPM, a
// database or S3; sync/rotation/Runtime.hpp wires the daemon's EncryptionManager, files table, fs cache and cloud
// engine into them.
//
// Invariants
//  - A files row only moves to a new (IV, key version) after every copy of the new ciphertext it will describe is
//    durable: the local sidecar is fsynced (file and directory) and, for cloud vaults that encrypt upstream, the
//    remote object has been replaced (PUT is atomic and the object carries its own IV/version as metadata).
//  - Both the old and the new local ciphertext exist until the row commits: the new bytes go to
//    `<backing>.vh-rotate`, the row is updated (compare-and-set on the old IV/version), then the sidecar is renamed
//    over the backing file and the directory fsynced.
//  - Recovery is decided by authentication, not by guessing which step ran: a sidecar is promoted iff it
//    authenticates under the row's current (IV, version); it is discarded iff the backing file does (or the row
//    says the bytes are not encrypted); otherwise both are kept and the rotation stays in progress.
//  - A rotation finishes only when nothing is unresolved, no file failed, and re-querying the files still on an
//    older key version comes back empty. Until then the old key stays loaded, so every file remains decryptable.
