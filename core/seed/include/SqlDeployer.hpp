// Migration files that were edited in place AFTER being shipped in a released tag.
//
// SqlDeployer records sha256(raw file bytes) per migration in schema_migrations and refuses to start when the
// recorded hash differs from the file on disk. Every entry below is a hash that a released package really shipped
// (so a real database may have recorded it) for a file whose content later changed. When the recorded hash matches
// one of these, the deployer accepts it, does NOT re-execute the file, and rewrites the recorded hash to the current
// one. The schema delta introduced by each in-place edit is owned by a separate, idempotent forward migration
// (named per entry), so re-running the edited file is never needed.
//
// Rewriting the recorded hash (instead of leaving the historical one) keeps the check strict: once a database is
// reconciled it matches the current file exactly, any later drift of that file fails again, and this table only
// matters for databases that have not yet upgraded past the edit.
//
// Rules:
//  - Never edit a shipped migration. Add the next-numbered forward migration instead.
//  - This table is append-only and reviewed. It must match the "historical" lines of
//    core/seed/shipped_migrations.lock; tools/contracts/test_migration_checksums_contract.py
//    enforces that and checks every released tag's deploy/psql against the lock when tags are available.
