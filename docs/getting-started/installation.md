# Installation

Vaulthalla is packaged for Linux systems that use APT, systemd, FUSE, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and TPM-compatible secret protection. The recommended path is the signed APT repository. Source installs are useful for development only.

## Before You Install

Plan these items first:

- A Linux host with systemd.
- A user account that will operate `vh`.
- PostgreSQL, either local or remote.
- Nginx if you want the web console exposed through a domain.
- Hardware TPM through `/dev/tpmrm0` or `/dev/tpm0`, or the packaged `swtpm` fallback.
- Enough disk space for `/var/lib/vaulthalla`, PostgreSQL, cache data, and any local vault bodies.

:::callout{theme="warning" title="Do not use the development install for production"}
`sudo make install -- -d` is a volatile development path. It can reset state and should not be used for production installs.
:::

## Recommended APT Install

Use the install script for the normal packaged install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apt.vaulthalla.sh/install.sh | bash
```

For an interactive install with prompts for optional setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apt.vaulthalla.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- --interactive
```

From a checked-out repository, the same helper is available as:

```bash
./bin/vh/install.sh
./bin/vh/install.sh --interactive
```

## Manual APT Setup

If you prefer to add the repository yourself:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://apt.vaulthalla.sh/pubkey.gpg -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/vaulthalla.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.vaulthalla.sh stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vaulthalla.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vaulthalla
```

## Install Profiles

The default package includes the core daemon, CLI, web runtime, systemd units, lifecycle utility, SQL assets, Nginx template, and recommended dependencies.

Use a lean install when the host already has the required services and you do not want recommended packages installed:

```bash
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends vaulthalla
```

Skip local database bootstrap during package install:

```bash
VH_SKIP_DB_BOOTSTRAP=1 sudo -E apt install vaulthalla
```

Skip Nginx setup during package install:

```bash
VH_SKIP_NGINX_CONFIG=1 sudo -E apt install vaulthalla
```

The repository helper also accepts install-time controls:

```bash
./bin/vh/install.sh --lean
./bin/vh/install.sh --no-db
./bin/vh/install.sh --no-nginx
./bin/vh/install.sh --assign-user <linux-user>
./bin/vh/install.sh --skip-admin-assign
```

## Optional Preview Packages

Two converter packages add previews that need heavy third-party libraries. `vaulthalla` only **Suggests** them, so a normal or lean install never pulls them in, and the core package installs and runs without Open CASCADE or FFmpeg's libraries:

| Package | Adds | Built on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vaulthalla-preview-cad` | STEP and STP models in the web console's 3D viewer (converted to glTF on the server) | Open CASCADE |
| `vaulthalla-preview-media` | Probing video and audio, poster frames, and **Convert for playback** for media the browser can't decode (H.264/AAC transcodes, including hardware encoders) | FFmpeg libraries |

Install either or both at any time:

```bash
sudo apt install vaulthalla-preview-cad vaulthalla-preview-media
```

Each package installs one helper program under `/usr/lib/vaulthalla/helpers/` and must match the installed `vaulthalla` version exactly. No restart or configuration is needed. The daemon never loads these libraries itself: it runs the helper as a separate process for each conversion, hands it the file's bytes over a private channel (nothing decrypted is written to disk), and the helper sandboxes itself so it cannot open files for writing, reach the network or start programs. Memory, CPU-time, wall-clock and output limits come from `preview.derive.*` in [Configuration](/reference/configuration#rich-previews).

Without the packages, STEP files are listed and downloadable but have no 3D preview, and browser-playable media still streams; the console explains that the converter isn't installed.

:::callout[Hardware video encoding is unvalidated]{variant="warning"}
`vaulthalla-preview-media` detects VAAPI, Intel Quick Sync and NVENC automatically (`preview.media.hwaccel: auto`) and falls back to software encoding (libx264) whenever a hardware encoder is missing or fails. The hardware paths have not yet been validated on real GPUs in this release; software encoding is the tested path.
:::

## What The Package Creates

The package installs these main runtime pieces:

- `vaulthalla.service` for the core daemon, which also owns the local CLI control socket `/run/vaulthalla/cli.sock`.
- `vaulthalla-web.service` for the packaged web console.
- `vaulthalla-swtpm.service` when the software TPM fallback is needed.
- `/usr/bin/vh` and `/usr/bin/vaulthalla`, both pointing at the CLI.
- `/etc/vaulthalla/config.yaml` for runtime configuration. It is copied from the packaged default at `/usr/share/vaulthalla/config/config.yaml` only when missing, and upgrades never overwrite it.
- `/var/lib/vaulthalla` for Vaulthalla state.
- `/run/vaulthalla` for sockets and runtime secrets.
- `/mnt/vaulthalla` for the FUSE filesystem surface.

See [Runtime Paths](/reference/runtime-paths) for the full path map.

## TPM Or Software TPM

Vaulthalla needs TPM-compatible key protection. The package prefers a hardware TPM when `/dev/tpmrm0` or `/dev/tpm0` is available. If no hardware TPM is available, the managed `swtpm` service provides a local software TPM with state under `/var/lib/swtpm/vaulthalla`.

If neither hardware TPM nor `swtpm` is usable (for example after `--no-install-recommends` on a VM), the install still completes, but the TPM backend is reported as deferred and `vaulthalla.service` is not started. Install the fallback and re-run configuration:

```bash
sudo apt install swtpm swtpm-tools
sudo dpkg-reconfigure vaulthalla
```

Use [Install Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/install-troubleshooting) to diagnose TPM and `swtpm` failures.

## Local PostgreSQL Bootstrap

When local PostgreSQL is installed and healthy, package setup creates the `vaulthalla` role and database and hands the generated password to the service, which seals it with the TPM. Upgrades never touch an existing role or database, and a remote database configured with `vh setup remote-db` is never bootstrapped locally.

If a `vaulthalla` database already exists but this host has no sealed credential for it (typically a reinstall after `apt purge`), setup asks whether to **adopt** it (keep the data and rotate the role password), **overwrite** it (drop and recreate), or **abort**. Noninteractive installs read `VH_EXISTING_DB_ACTION=adopt|overwrite|abort` and default to abort, which stops configuration without changing PostgreSQL:

```bash
sudo env VH_EXISTING_DB_ACTION=adopt dpkg --configure -a
sudo env VH_EXISTING_DB_ACTION=overwrite dpkg --configure -a
```

Adopting keeps users and vault metadata, but vault encryption keys and stored provider API keys are only recoverable if the original `/var/lib/vaulthalla/.sealed_*.blob` files and the same TPM are restored.

You can also bootstrap later:

```bash
sudo vh setup db
sudo vh setup db --adopt      # keep an existing database without a sealed credential
sudo vh setup db --overwrite  # drop it and start fresh
```

`vh setup db` reports success only after `vaulthalla.service` stays running and has consumed the password handoff.

`VH_SKIP_DB_BOOTSTRAP=1` and `VH_SKIP_NGINX_CONFIG=1` opt-outs are remembered across upgrades. `vh setup db` and `vh setup nginx` opt back in.

For a remote database, use:

```bash
sudo vh setup remote-db --host <host> --port 5432 --user <user> --database <name> --password-file <path>
```

## Nginx And TLS

Package setup can configure Nginx when the host has Nginx active and the lifecycle checks are low risk. You can also configure it later:

```bash
sudo vh setup nginx --domain vault.example.com
sudo vh setup nginx --domain vault.example.com --certbot
sudo vh setup nginx --domain vaulthalla.dev --s3-domain s3.vaulthalla.dev --certbot-dns-cloudflare --cloudflare-credentials /etc/vaulthalla/certbot/cloudflare.ini
```

On a fresh install, the unmodified distro default site (`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`) would shadow the Vaulthalla site on port 80, so setup disables that symlink and records it. `apt remove`, `apt purge`, and `vh teardown nginx` restore it. A modified default site is never touched. Setup then requests `http://127.0.0.1/` and reports whether the console actually answers. Upgrades never re-enable a site you removed.

The web console reaches the daemon through Nginx. Fresh installs bind the websocket (36969) and preview (36970) servers to `127.0.0.1`.

The managed site turns off Nginx proxy buffering on `/preview` and `/download`, so decrypted downloads and media streams pass straight through and are never spooled to Nginx's temporary files. Upgrades never rewrite an existing site; on upgraded hosts streaming still works without buffering because the daemon sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no` on every streamed response.

The Certbot option validates prerequisites and uses rollback behavior if certificate setup fails. The Cloudflare DNS-01 option issues a certificate without requiring an inbound HTTP challenge endpoint and renders a dedicated HTTPS S3 host.

## Verify The Install

After installation:

```bash
vh status
systemctl status vaulthalla.service
systemctl status vaulthalla-web.service
```

If the CLI reports a socket or permission error, finish [First Run](/getting-started/first-run), especially the admin Linux UID and `vaulthalla` group steps.

## Remove Or Purge

Remove the package while preserving most state:

```bash
sudo apt remove vaulthalla
```

Purge package-managed config:

```bash
sudo apt purge vaulthalla
```

Purge removes `/etc/vaulthalla/config.yaml`, `/var/log/vaulthalla`, `/var/log/vaulthalla-package.log`, the web cache, and the contents of `/var/lib/vaulthalla`, including the sealed secrets. If `/var/lib/vaulthalla` is a mount point, such as a dedicated data disk, purge empties it without crossing into other filesystems and keeps the directory. Operator-provided certbot credentials under `/etc/vaulthalla/certbot/` are kept because certbot renewal still references them.

Package purge does not silently destroy a preserved database. Interactive purge flows may offer database cleanup. Noninteractive purge preserves database state. `vh` is gone after purge, so remove a preserved database with:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS vaulthalla WITH (FORCE);'
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'DROP ROLE IF EXISTS vaulthalla;'
```

While the package is installed, tear down the local database with this command, which stops `vaulthalla.service` first:

```bash
sudo vh teardown db
```

Reinstalling after `apt remove` re-enables and starts the services.

To remove managed Nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo vh teardown nginx
```
