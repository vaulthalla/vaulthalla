# S3 Gateway Semantics

This page summarizes how S3 operations map to Vaulthalla vault state. The gateway aims for useful S3-compatible client behavior while keeping Vaulthalla metadata, encryption, sync, and budget rules authoritative.

:::toc[On this page]{depth="3" theme="compact"}
:::

## LIST

LIST is metadata-only. It uses gateway object metadata, Vaulthalla filesystem metadata, and sync-maintained remote object indexes.

LIST does not decrypt object bodies, read plaintext to calculate ETags, refresh manifests, or call upstream S3/R2 LIST/HEAD/GET APIs.

## HEAD

HEAD returns client-visible gateway metadata when available. Remote-backed buckets can answer metadata-backed HEAD requests from known Vaulthalla state or the remote object index without downloading object bodies.

## GET

GET can be served from:

- Local encrypted Vaulthalla files.
- Materialized remote-cache files.
- A remote-only upstream object download when the vault policy allows it.

Only the remote-only download path consumes actual upstream request and price budgets inside the gateway request. Local/cache reads do not consume provider, vault, or global upstream budgets by default.

## PUT, COPY, And Multipart Completion

PUT, COPY destination writes, and multipart completion write Vaulthalla local state and gateway metadata first. For remote-backed gateway buckets, sync owns eventual upstream upload, index, manifest, request-budget, storage-class, and encryption side effects.

Downstream clients receive the S3 response after Vaulthalla accepts the local state. They should not interpret that response as proof that upstream provider upload has completed.

## DELETE

Gateway DELETE is unversioned from the S3 client perspective.

Local buckets remove local Vaulthalla object state, object metadata, backing/cache files, and filesystem cache mappings. Remote-backed buckets mark or remove Vaulthalla local object state first, clear gateway metadata, and hide the object from future S3 LIST/HEAD/GET immediately.

The gateway does not directly delete upstream S3/R2 objects as the primary DELETE behavior. Sync observes the local delete or tombstone and owns eventual upstream purge.

## ETags And Metadata

S3 ETags are client-visible gateway metadata. They are not the same thing as Vaulthalla local `content_hash`.

| Source | ETag behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Single PUT | MD5 of the S3 request body, quoted. |
| Multipart upload | S3-style MD5 of part MD5 digests plus `-part_count`, quoted. |
| Existing Vaulthalla files without gateway ETags | Metadata-derived fallback ETags during LIST and HEAD. |

`x-amz-meta-*` headers are preserved as gateway object metadata. `Content-Type` is preserved when provided and falls back to `application/octet-stream`.

## Multipart Storage

Multipart upload parts live under Vaulthalla-owned hidden backing paths with opaque per-upload directories. They are not stored under the bucket or object-key path while an upload is in progress.

Parts are removed when the upload completes, aborts, or expires according to `s3_gateway.multipart.abort_after_days`.

## Backfill

Backfill imports existing Vaulthalla files or remote-index rows into gateway object metadata:

```bash
vh s3-gateway bucket backfill archive
```

The default path is metadata-only. Use ETag calculation only when the operator intentionally wants local body reads:

```bash
vh s3-gateway bucket backfill archive --calculate-etags
```

`--calculate-etags` reads and decrypts local file bodies to calculate plaintext MD5 ETags and prints a warning. It is not invoked by LIST.

## Limitations

Current S3 Gateway behavior does not implement:

- IAM policy or bucket policy emulation.
- ACLs.
- S3 object versioning.
- Lifecycle rules.
- Object lock, legal hold, or MFA delete.
- Vaulthalla undo-delete integration for gateway deletes.

Large PUT and multipart bodies are accepted by the gateway path, but operators should size `max_body_size_mb`, client retry behavior, and request budgets for the workload.
