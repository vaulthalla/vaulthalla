# General Troubleshooting

Use this guide after Vaulthalla is installed but an operator workflow is failing.

:::toc[On this page]{depth="3" theme="compact"}
:::

## Fast Triage

```bash
vh status
systemctl status vaulthalla.service
systemctl status vaulthalla-web.service
journalctl -u vaulthalla.service -n 200
```

For vault sync:

```bash
vh vault sync info <vault>
vh vault sync dry-run <vault>
```

For permissions:

```bash
vh user info <user>
vh vault role list <vault>
vh permissions --type vault
```

## CLI Permission Error

Check:

```bash
id
getent group vaulthalla
ls -l /run/vaulthalla/cli.sock
```

If group membership was just changed, refresh the session with `newgrp vaulthalla` or log out and back in. Then confirm the Vaulthalla user has the expected Linux UID mapping.

## Web Login Works But Pages Are Empty

Check the core daemon and WebSocket path:

```bash
systemctl status vaulthalla.service
journalctl -u vaulthalla.service -n 200
sudo nginx -t
```

If the dashboard loads but filesystem or vault data does not, check the user's admin role, vault role, and group membership.

## Previews And Media

Start with the basics:

- The user's vault role (or the share link's operations) allows what the file needs. Image and PDF previews need `preview`; originals, video and audio, 3D models, text and STEP models need `download`. A preview-only share link refuses those by design. See [File Previews](/web-console/previews).
- `http_preview_server.enabled` is true and Nginx proxies `/preview`, `/download` and `/upload` to it (`sudo nginx -t`).
- The daemon can read the file: try downloading it as a user with known vault access.

Then search the daemon log for the failing request:

```bash
journalctl -u vaulthalla.service -n 500 | grep -Ei 'HttpHandler|IntegrityRegistry|DerivedStore|HttpServer'
```

### Converter Unavailable

The console says "The 3D converter isn't installed" or "Server-side conversion isn't available", and the HTTP response is `503` with `"code": "converter_unavailable"` and the helper it needs. Install the optional package; no restart is needed:

```bash
sudo apt install vaulthalla-preview-cad      # STEP/STP models
sudo apt install vaulthalla-preview-media    # Convert for playback, posters, media probing
ls -l /usr/lib/vaulthalla/helpers/
```

If the package is installed, check that `preview.derive.helper_dir` (default `/usr/lib/vaulthalla/helpers`) points at it and that its version matches `vaulthalla` exactly. The daemon also reports a helper as unavailable, and logs why once, when:

- The helper, or any directory above it, is not owned by root or is writable by group or others. Packaged helpers always pass; a hand-copied helper may not.
- The helper refused to run because it could not sandbox itself. Helpers require Landlock and seccomp; on a kernel without Landlock (or with it left out of the `lsm=` boot parameter) every conversion reports `converter_unavailable`.

```bash
journalctl -u vaulthalla.service | grep -E 'refusing to run converter helper|refuses to run'
cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm    # must list landlock
```

### STEP Conversion Or Media Transcode Failed

"This model could not be converted" or "The conversion failed" (HTTP `422`, `"code": "conversion_failed"` with a reason) means the helper rejected the file, ran out of a limit, or crashed. The failure is cached: the same file version is not retried until it changes or `preview.derive.failure_ttl_hours` (24 by default) passes, so a malformed or hostile file can't cause a retry storm. Typical reasons are a malformed or unsupported file, or a `preview.derive` limit (memory, CPU time, wall clock, output size) that a large model or long video exceeded. Raise the specific limit if the file is legitimate, then save a new version of the file or wait for the failure to expire.

"The server is busy" (HTTP `503` with `Retry-After`) means the conversion queue (`preview.derive.max_queue`), the render slots, or `http_preview_server.max_connections` are full. It clears on its own.

### Content Unavailable For Cloud Files

A file in an S3/R2 vault whose bytes are only in the bucket (not cached locally) answers `503` with `"code": "content_unavailable"` when the server may not fetch it: `preview.media.remote` is `off`, or the vault's request or price budget refused the fetch. Check the budgets with `vh vault sync info <vault>` and `vh pricing budget status`, or change `preview.media.remote`. File-list thumbnails never fetch remote-only files, so those rows simply have no thumbnail.

### Integrity Failures

Vault files are authenticated with AES-GCM. A stream that fails the check stops, and the log shows `AES-GCM verification FAILED for file:<vault id>:<file id> — streams aborted` (and `Integrity failure serving …` for the request, which answers `500` with `"code": "integrity_failed"`).

- With `preview.media.integrity: optimistic` (the default), a stream starts at once and the whole file is verified once in the background; a failure cuts off every stream of that file version, so a browser may have received part of the file before it stopped.
- With `strict`, nothing is sent until the file has verified, so a corrupt file never starts streaming.

Either way, once a file version has failed, the daemon refuses it until the file changes (a restart verifies it again from scratch). A failure means the stored ciphertext does not match its key and IV: disk corruption, an out-of-band edit of the backing file, or a restore that mixed files and database rows from different points in time. Do not overwrite it blindly; restore the file from a backup and see [Backup And Recovery](/vaults/backup-and-recovery).

### Nginx Buffering On Upgraded Hosts

The managed Nginx site on fresh installs sets `proxy_buffering off` and `proxy_max_temp_file_size 0` on `/preview` and `/download`. Upgrades never rewrite an existing site, so older sites don't have those lines; streaming still works because the daemon sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no` on every streamed response, which tells Nginx not to buffer it. If you run a hand-written site or a different proxy, make sure it doesn't buffer `/download` and `/preview` responses to disk, since those contain decrypted file content.

## S3/R2 Vault Cannot Connect

Inspect the API key and vault:

```bash
vh api-key info <key>
vh vault info <vault>
vh vault sync dry-run <vault> --refresh-index
```

Check:

- Endpoint URL is correct.
- Provider value matches the service.
- Bucket exists.
- Credentials allow required bucket/object operations.
- Region is correct or `auto` is appropriate.
- Request and price budgets are not blocking the operation.

## Sync Stalled

A stalled sync is often protective behavior. Start with:

```bash
vh vault sync info <vault>
vh vault sync dry-run <vault>
```

Common stall causes:

- Request budget exceeded.
- Price budget enforcement denied the run.
- Remote index is stale.
- Manifest conflict repeated.
- Archive-tier object needs provider restore.
- Missing encryption metadata for an encrypted remote object.
- Conflict policy requires operator decision.

Raise only the limit or fix only the condition named in the stall reason.

## Remote Index Is Stale

Options:

```bash
vh vault sync dry-run <vault> --refresh-index
vh vault sync inventory <vault> --file inventory.csv
vh vault sync events <vault> --file s3-events.json
vh vault sync reconcile <vault> --allow-list-scan
```

For large buckets, prefer inventory plus event ingestion over repeated full scans.

## Cost Control Blocks Work

Request budget:

```bash
vh vault sync info <vault>
vh vault sync dry-run <vault>
vh vault sync set <vault> --s3-budget-get 2000
```

Price budget:

```bash
vh pricing budget status
vh pricing budget ledger --limit 50
vh pricing budget set-vault <vault> --mode warn --max-run 1
```

Do not switch to unlimited until a dry-run proves the operation is intentional and bounded by some other control.

## Encrypted S3 Object Cannot Be Read

Check:

- Upstream object metadata includes Vaulthalla encryption metadata.
- The vault key version exists.
- The remote index is current.
- The object was not overwritten outside Vaulthalla without preserving metadata.
- The vault was not switched between encrypted and unencrypted behavior without a migration plan.

If key material may be missing, stop and preserve current PostgreSQL, `/var/lib/vaulthalla`, bucket data, and any key exports before attempting repair.

## Share Link Does Not Work

Check:

- The share is still enabled.
- The URL was copied at create or rotate time.
- The recipient completed email validation if required.
- Operator email is healthy for email-validated shares.
- The share role includes the needed operation.
- The underlying vault object still exists.

Email checks:

```bash
vh email doctor
vh email history --limit 100
```

## Backup Readiness Looks Wrong

Dashboard backup/recovery indicators are status and policy signals. They do not prove that a database dump, state archive, key export, or bucket backup has run.

Use [Backup And Recovery](/vaults/backup-and-recovery) to build and test a real recovery set.

## Before Manual Repair

Before direct database edits, state deletion, or bucket rewrites:

1. Stop affected services if needed.
2. Back up PostgreSQL.
3. Back up `/etc/vaulthalla`.
4. Back up `/var/lib/vaulthalla`.
5. Back up `/var/lib/swtpm/vaulthalla` if using software TPM.
6. Export vault keys and internal secrets where possible.

Manual repair without recovery material can convert a recoverable fault into data loss.
