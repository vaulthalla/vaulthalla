# Architecture Map

This is the contributor-facing map of the repo. It is not a full internal design document. Its job is to help you answer five questions quickly:

1. what subsystem am I touching
2. where does that code live
3. how sharp is it
4. what kind of contribution is appropriate
5. what should I validate before opening a PR

## Top-Level Repo Map

| Area | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| `core/` | C++ daemon, CLI transport, FUSE service, runtime manager, auth, RBAC, crypto, sync, storage, previews, tests, usage/manpage generation |
| `web/` | Next.js admin and filesystem client, websocket session and data layer, login-gate middleware |
| `deploy/` | Runtime config, PostgreSQL schema SQL, systemd units, nginx template, lifecycle utility |
| `debian/` | Debian package metadata and maintainer scripts |
| `bin/` | Dev and operator install/uninstall/test helpers |
| `release.toml`, `.release/` | vl-release configuration and the staged release notes and changelog for the next release |
| `tools/contracts/` | Contract tests for Debian packaging, maintainer scripts, shipped migrations, and the release workflow |
| `.github/` | CI workflows and composite actions |

## Subsystem Map

| Subsystem | What it does | Main paths | Contribution fit | Likely validation |

| Release process | vl-release (`vlr`) keeps versions in sync, builds and validates the package, publishes to APT and records the release history | `release.toml`, `.release/*`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `web/bin/build_release_payload.sh` | Maintainer-guided | `bash tools/dev/verify.sh release packaging`, `make deb` |
| Tests and harnesses | Unit, integration, lifecycle, and packaging contract coverage | `core/tests/*`, `deploy/lifecycle/tests/*`, `tools/contracts/*`, `tools/lab/tests/*` | Open for scoped work | Run the relevant test surface and avoid unrelated churn |

## Subsystem Notes

### Core runtime

`core/src/runtime/Manager.cpp` is where service orchestration comes together. If your change affects startup order, restart behavior, shutdown behavior, or service wiring, treat it as maintainer-guided work.

### FUSE and filesystem semantics

`core/src/fuse/Service.cpp` mounts the filesystem with `allow_other` and `auto_unmount`. That is not casual plumbing. Filesystem behavior changes can affect user data, trust boundaries, and operator expectations.

### CLI and shell protocol

`core/main/cli.cpp` talks to the local control socket at `/run/vaulthalla/cli.sock`. Help text and usage improvements are easy contributions. Protocol or privileged lifecycle command changes are not.

### Web/admin surface

The web client is a real contributor surface, but it is still wired into auth and websocket behavior. Small UX work is fair game. New flows, new command surfaces, and auth/session changes should start with discussion.

One practical caveat: the CI web build syncs private icon assets from `~/vaulthalla-web-icons` in `.github/actions/build_web/action.yml`. If you are touching web UI and hit build failures related to missing private icons, coordinate with the maintainer rather than stubbing fake assets into the repo.

### Previews, downloads and the byte-serving spine

Every byte the HTTP lanes hand out (downloads, media playback, 3D models, text, thumbnails, converter input) goes through one funnel, `storage::Engine::openPlaintextReader`, which returns a `storage::PlaintextReader` over one exact file version:

- `GcmFileReader` serves positioned reads from the AES-256-GCM ciphertext by `pread`ing only the requested region and decrypting it with the GCM counter keystream. No plaintext is written anywhere.
- `crypto::IntegrityRegistry` authenticates each file version's GCM tag once and shares the verdict with every reader of that version. `preview.media.integrity: optimistic` serves immediately and aborts every live reader if verification fails; `strict` verifies before the first byte. A failed version stays refused until the file changes.
- `protocols/http/Access.cpp` is the only place a route's need (Preview, Download, Overwrite) is mapped onto RBAC: vault filesystem permissions for signed-in users, `share::TargetResolver` for share links. Handlers in `protocols/http/handler/` only see resolved targets and serve them with conditional GET, single Range, HEAD and chunked streaming. Each connection runs on its own thread, capped by `http_preview_server.max_connections`, with real read/write deadlines.
- `preview::cache::Store` holds every derived artifact (thumbnails, page renders, posters, GLB from STEP, transcodes) as a `VHDERIV1` file sealed with the vault key, with the artifact's identity bound into the GCM associated data and keyed to the source file's version, indexed in `cache_index` (migration 103). It is disposable: evicted by size and age and regenerated on demand.
- `preview::derive::Runner` spawns the optional converter helpers (`core/tools/preview-cad`, `core/tools/preview-media`) as separate sandboxed processes that pull plaintext over a socketpair. Their libraries (Open CASCADE, FFmpeg, libseccomp) are never linked into the daemon.

Read [Security-Sensitive Work](/contributors/security-sensitive-work#preview-and-download-invariants) before changing any of this.

### Database and schema

`deploy/psql/000_schema.sql` through the highest-numbered `deploy/psql/NNN_*.sql` define the installed schema surface; new migrations take the next number. Schema work is sharp because it crosses packaging, bootstrap, runtime queries, retention, and upgrade safety.

### Packaging and lifecycle

The Debian maintainer scripts in `debian/postinst`, `debian/prerm`, and `debian/postrm` are the lifecycle source of truth for install, upgrade, remove, and purge. The `bin/` scripts are helpful local wrappers, but they are not the Debian contract.

### Releases

Releases are cut with [vl-release](https://github.com/valkyrianlabs/vl-release) (`vlr`). `release.toml` is the contract: the version files kept in sync, what the Debian package must and must never contain, and where it is published. Release notes and the Debian changelog are written ahead of time in `.release/`, in the same change as the code they describe; the published `debian/changelog` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` are written only by `vlr prepare` during a release. Treat this as a product surface, not a scratchpad.

## Read By Interest

If you are working on:

- docs and onboarding: start with [Contribution Boundaries](/contributors/contribution-boundaries) and [Validation Guide](/contributors/validation-guide)
- web/admin polish: read `web/src/app/*`, `web/src/components/*`, and `web/src/stores/*`
- CLI help and examples: read `core/usage/*` and `core/main/cli.cpp`
- packaging: read [Packaging and Release](/contributors/packaging-and-release), then `debian/*` and `deploy/systemd/*`
- security-sensitive work: read [Security-Sensitive Work](/contributors/security-sensitive-work) first
