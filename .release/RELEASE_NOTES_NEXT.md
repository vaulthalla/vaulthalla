# Rich previews and safer key rotation

## Safer vault key rotation

**Vault key rotation can no longer strand files on a dropped key.** A rotation now finishes only when every encrypted file was re-encrypted and committed; if any file fails, is open, or changes mid-way, the previous key stays loaded (so everything stays readable) and the next sync retries. Each file's new ciphertext is written to a durable side file and swapped in only after the database records its new IV, and an interrupted rotation is repaired on the next sync or restart by keeping whichever copy authenticates. Cloud vaults in Cache mode now rewrite their local copies too, remote-only files are re-encrypted without writing anything locally, and empty files no longer abort a rotation. File overwrites through the web and API also replace ciphertext atomically.

## Cloud vaults: local copies first, remote-only files readable

**Reading a cloud file that is stored locally no longer downloads it from S3.** Share-link downloads and previews and the built-in S3 gateway read the local encrypted copy, which costs no requests or egress (gateway range requests read only the requested bytes). **Files that exist only in the bucket (Cache mode) can now be previewed and downloaded:** the first read fetches the object once, after the same price-budget check sync uses and under a strict request cap, verifies it in full, and keeps it as a local encrypted copy (an object stored unencrypted upstream is encrypted on the way in; nothing decrypted touches the disk). Budget refusals are reported as unavailable instead of spending. Operators who would rather not keep copies can opt into metered range reads (`preview.media.remote: ranged`; note that individual ranges are not integrity-checked) or turn remote reads off (`off`). Fetched copies are not evicted yet.

## STEP/STP models in the 3D viewer (optional package)

Install `vaulthalla-preview-cad` to preview STEP and STP CAD models: the server converts each model to glTF once, and the web console shows it in the 3D viewer. Conversion runs in a separate, sandboxed helper process, never inside the daemon: it gets the file's bytes over a private channel (nothing decrypted is written to disk), cannot open files for writing, reach the network or start programs, and is killed if it exceeds its memory, CPU-time, wall-clock or output limits (`preview.derive.*` in `config.yaml`). A malformed or hostile model fails that one conversion and nothing else.

`vaulthalla-preview-cad` and `vaulthalla-preview-media` are separate packages that `vaulthalla` only suggests, so the core package still installs without Open CASCADE or FFmpeg's libraries. Every new `preview.*` setting is optional; the shipped `config.yaml` lists them, commented out, with their defaults.

### Optional media helper (`vaulthalla-preview-media`)

- A new optional helper probes video and audio files (container, codecs, duration, and whether Chrome, Firefox
  and Safari can play them directly), renders poster frames, and transcodes to browser-safe H.264/AAC as
  fragmented MP4 or HLS. It runs out of process, reads plaintext only through the daemon's range channel (no
  plaintext temp files, and MP4 files with the index at the end are read in place), and sandboxes itself before
  touching input. Output size, duration, dimensions and wall time are capped.
- Hardware encoding (`preview.media.hwaccel`: VAAPI, Quick Sync, NVENC) is probed and falls back to software on
  any failure. Hardware paths have not yet been validated on real GPUs; software (libx264) is the tested path.

## Web console
### Previews in the web console

The preview sheet now opens far more than images and PDFs, in the console and on share links:

- **Video and audio** play in the browser with seeking, straight from the encrypted vault (no autoplay). When
  your browser can't decode a format you get a Download button and, when the optional media converter is
  installed on the server, a "Convert for playback" option.
- **PDFs** page through every page (buttons or PageUp/PageDown), fitted to the page or the width.
- **3D models** (GLB, glTF, STL, OBJ, and STEP when the optional CAD converter is installed) open in an interactive viewer you can
  orbit, pan and zoom. The viewer only downloads when you open a model.
- **Text, code and Markdown** files open as text (Markdown rendered safely: no embedded HTML, no remote images).
  In the console you can edit and save them in place; if someone else saved the file since you opened it, you
  choose whether to reload their version, overwrite it, or copy your text, and nothing is lost silently.
- **SVG and WebP** images show as they are.
- Share links respect their permissions: a preview-only link shows image and PDF previews, and explains that
  video, audio, 3D and text need a link that allows downloads.
- Downloads of any size stream directly; the console checks a download with a lightweight request first instead
  of starting it twice.
