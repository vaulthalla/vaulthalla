# Safer vault key rotation

**Vault key rotation can no longer strand files on a dropped key.** A rotation now finishes only when every encrypted file was re-encrypted and committed; if any file fails, is open, or changes mid-way, the previous key stays loaded (so everything stays readable) and the next sync retries. Each file's new ciphertext is written to a durable side file and swapped in only after the database records its new IV, and an interrupted rotation is repaired on the next sync or restart by keeping whichever copy authenticates. Cloud vaults in Cache mode now rewrite their local copies too, remote-only files are re-encrypted without writing anything locally, and empty files no longer abort a rotation. File overwrites through the web and API also replace ciphertext atomically.
