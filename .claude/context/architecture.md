# Architecture: core daemon, protocols, runtime

Verified against `main` @ 1.6.6 (2026-09-30). Merges the old `.codex` repo-overview,
core-backend, and protocol-map docs, with stale claims corrected.

## Build graph

- Root `meson.build` holds `project('vaulthalla', 'cpp', version: '1.6.6')`: `cpp_std=c++23`,
  `unity=on`, `unity_size=9`, `warning_level=3`, `werror=false`, `prefix=/usr`, meson >= 1.3.0.
  It enters C++ via `subdir('core')` and also installs `deploy/lifecycle` → `/usr/lib/vaulthalla/lifecycle`.
- `core/meson.build`: deps `fuse3 libsodium libcurl boost libpqxx-vh pdfium yaml-cpp spdlog fmt
  openssl>=3 tss2-esys tss2-tctildr tss2-rc libmagic libjpeg libturbojpeg pugixml uuid zlib threads`.
  The two Vaulthalla-built SDKs come only from apt.vaulthalla.sh: `libpqxx-vh-dev` (libpqxx 8, a **static** archive
  under its own pkg-config name `libpqxx-vh`, so servers need only `libpq5`) and `libpdfium-dev` (Chromium-tracking
  PDFium, runtime `libpdfium<branch>`, e.g. `libpdfium8059`). The pdfium dependency carries a version window
  (`>=155.8059`, `<1000`) because the retired `20250629` fork snapshot sorts higher; `tools/contracts` pins both.
  libpqxx stays out of the -O0 PCH (GCC drops its `#pragma GCC diagnostic` fences there).
  It generates `paths.h` (config/runtime/mount/state/log/psql paths, lines ~35-44).
- Artifacts: `vaulthalla-server`, `vaulthalla-cli`, `vh_usage` (manpage markdown generator),
  static libs `vaulthalla`, `vhseed`, `vhusage`, `vhusage-native`; tests `vh_unit_tests`, `vh_integration_tests`.
- `meson.options`: `manpage` (true), `install_data` (true), `build_unit_tests` (false),
  `integration_tests` (false), `systemd_system_unit_dir` (`/lib/systemd/system`), `udev_rules_dir`, `tmpfiles_dir`.
- Vendored code lives in `core/vendor/`. Seed data is in `core/seed/`, and test fixtures are in `core/test-assets/`.

### Unity-build hygiene (invariant)

Unity builds concatenate `.cpp` files, so file-scope `using namespace` leaks into neighbours. The
CI-only `reference to 'Vault' is ambiguous` failures came from filesystem-order-dependent grouping.
- Source discovery in `core/meson.build` is piped through `LC_ALL=C sort`. Keep it that way.
- **Don't add file-scope `using namespace` in `core/src/**/*.cpp`.** Wrap definitions in their
  namespace, or use narrow aliases. About 340 file-scope directives remain, so don't make it worse.
  A newer one is at `db/query/sync/RemoteObjectIndex.cpp:13`.
- Never weaken the unity, warning, or werror settings to get a build green.

**Forward declarations.** Each subsystem that other code refers to by pointer or reference has a declaration-only
`Fwd.hpp` (`identities/`, `auth/`, `storage/`, `vault/`, `fs/`, `rbac/`, `share/`, `sync/`, `crypto/`,
`protocols/ws/`, `protocols/shell/`; earlier: `rbac/resolver/*/Fwd.hpp`). Include the narrowest one instead of
writing `namespace vh::x { struct Y; }` again, and `db/Fwd.hpp` for libpqxx classes (it adds libpqxx 8's `row_ref`/`field_ref`
to `<pqxx/types>`). Keep them declarations only:
no includes of definitions, no aliases, one subsystem each (no global fwd header). Add a type to its subsystem's
Fwd.hpp once it's forward-declared in more than one place. The `vh_usage` library (`core/usage`) can't see
`core/include` and keeps its own declarations.

## Process model

`core/main/main.cpp` boot sequence: config + log registries → DB init + prepared statements +
optional seed → runtime deps → storage wiring (+ derived-cache startup sweep) → `runtime::Manager` start → wait
for SIGINT/SIGTERM. Shutdown: `Manager::stopAll` → `preview::derive::Queue::shutdown()` → thread pools.

`core/src/runtime/Manager.cpp` owns the service lifecycle. It runs a watchdog every 2s and restarts
a service after 500ms. Start order:

```
FUSE → SyncController → DBJanitor → VaultRetentionService → LogRotationService → StatsSnapshotService →
OperatorEmailService → ConnectionLifecycleManager → ProtocolService → S3GatewayService (+ ShellServer)
```

Stop order is the reverse, with the ShellServer stopped right after ProtocolService.
ShellServer is not created in test mode (`paths::testMode`).

## Protocol surfaces (`core/src/protocols/`)

| Surface | Code | Default bind (shipped `deploy/config/config.yaml`) |
|---|---|---|
| WebSocket `/ws` | `ws/Server.cpp`, `ws/Router.cpp`, `ws/Handler.cpp`, `ws/handler/*`, `ws/Session.cpp` | `0.0.0.0:36969` |
| HTTP preview/download/upload/auth | `http/Server.cpp`, `http/Session.cpp`, `http/Router.cpp`, `http/Access.cpp`, `http/handler/*`, `http/upload/Coordinator.cpp` | `0.0.0.0:36970` (fresh installs: `127.0.0.1`) |
| S3 gateway (SigV4, multipart) | `s3/*` (`GatewayService`, `SigV4`, `ObjectStore`, `MultipartStore`, `CredentialManager`) | `0.0.0.0:39000`, disabled by default |
| Shell/CLI control | `shell/Server.cpp`, `shell/Router.cpp`, `shell/commands/*` | unix socket `/run/vaulthalla/cli.sock` |

> `core/include/config/Config.hpp` compiled-in defaults are **33369/33370**, but the shipped config,
> web fallbacks, and Caddyfile all use **36969/36970**. Trust the config file, and treat that
> header/config mismatch as a known wart.

### Shell CLI flow

`vh` / `vaulthalla` are symlinks to `vaulthalla-cli` (created by `bin/setup/install_dirs.sh` and the Debian payload).
1. `core/main/cli.cpp` normalizes args and connects to `/run/vaulthalla/cli.sock`.
2. It sends a JSON frame `{cmd, args, line, interactive}`.
3. `shell/Server.cpp` authenticates the peer by UID/group (the `vaulthalla` group plus the app-user UID mapping), answers
   with a `{"type":"hello"}` frame, then dispatches the frame. Each client runs on its own thread (cap 16, extra
   clients get exit 75 "busy"); request reads time out after 10s, prompt answers after 15 min, sends after 30s, and
   writes use `MSG_NOSIGNAL`. `status`/`version` skip the DB user lookup so they work while the DB is down.
4. `shell/Router.cpp` with `core/include/protocols/shell/Parser.hpp` tokenizes the line and runs the handler; output frames stream back.
   Before dispatch the Router rejects options the usage definitions don't declare: each option must be declared by
   a node on the path the positionals select (argument words are skipped), or match a declared `option_prefixes`
   family (role commands' generated `--allow-*`/`--deny-*`). `--help`/`-h` are always accepted.
   `test_cli_options.cpp` keeps definitions honest: every documented example must pass this check, and every
   subcommand name a handler dispatches on must be defined.
5. Usage/help comes from `core/usage/*` (root alias hard-coded as `vh`). The same code drives the `vh_usage` manpage
   generator and the integration-test command models, so CLI UX changes ripple into man pages and tests.

Invariants: the **daemon owns `/run/vaulthalla/cli.sock`** (binds it itself; every ~1s it checks the path still points
at its listener and rebinds if something replaced it). `deploy/systemd/vaulthalla-cli.{socket,service}` are obsolete
(`vaulthalla-cli --systemd` never existed as a mode; the unit connected to its own socket and hung) and should not be
shipped. The client waits at most `VAULTHALLA_CLI_TIMEOUT` (default 10s) for the first frame and exits 69 (no daemon),
75 (not responding), 77 (not in the `vaulthalla` group), 76 (reply without exit status). `vh status` exits 0/1/2 for
healthy/degraded/critical and includes a live `SELECT 1` DB probe.

### WebSocket flow

**Connection cap (#164).** `ws::Server::onAccept` takes a `ConnectionSlot` (`protocols/ws/ConnectionLimit.hpp`)
under `websocket_server.max_connections` (read per accept, default 1024, 0 acts as 1); over the cap the socket gets
a raw `503` + `Retry-After: 1` without reading the upgrade request, and a warning at most once a minute with the
refused count. The session holds the slot and gives it back on its first `close()` (or destruction); connections
that fail before the websocket handshake (header read, hydration, handshake error) now `close()` at once instead of
lingering in the session manager until the lifecycle sweep.

The web client builds `ws(s)://<host>/ws` in `web/src/util/getUrl.ts` (overridable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULTHALLA_WS_ORIGIN`).
`web/src/stores/useWebSocket.ts` handles reconnect, the pending-request map keyed by `requestId`, and token injection.
Router allowlists are **exact and per session mode**: unauthenticated, human, pending-share, and ready-share.
Only the session-lifecycle commands (`auth.login`, `auth.logout`, `auth.refresh`, `auth.isAuthenticated`) skip
access-token validation (`isSessionLifecycleCommand`, mirrored by the web's
`SESSION_LIFECYCLE_COMMANDS`). Every other `auth.*` command (register, user update/delete/get/list, password change)
is account management and goes through `RequireHumanAuth`. A `starts_with("auth")` rule used to let unauthenticated
sockets reach handlers that dereference `session->user` (a remote daemon segfault); `WsAuthRouting.*` guards it.
There is no password gate (removed in 1.8.0, with the universal default password): a valid session is fully
authenticated. The super admin's initial-credential posture is advisory only: `auth.security.status` (human auth,
read once per page load) returns the initial password file path for `admin` while the generated password is in use
and the file exists; the web shows `InitialPasswordWarning`. Credential lifecycle: `core/auth/Bootstrap.hpp`
(see "Super-admin initial credential" below). `auth.login` is rate-limited per IP + account
(`ShareRateLimit.cpp`). The Router's debug log redacts credentials (`LogRedaction.cpp`); never log a raw ws message.
Refused requests (unauthorized, rate limited) warn once per client + command per 60s and count the rest
(`RefusalLogThrottle`, bounded map + overflow bucket, summary "suppressed N more in Ns"); per-request detail is
debug only, and client-invented command names share one label so they can't mint a warning each (#135).
See `link-sharing.md`.

### Super-admin initial credential

No universal default password. `seed::initAdmin` (fresh DB only: `initDB` seeds when no `admin` row exists) calls
`auth::bootstrap::issueInitialCredential()`: 16 CSPRNG bytes as 32 hex characters, hashed normally, plaintext written
atomically (temp + rename, 0600, daemon user) to `<backing path>/super_admin_initial_password`
(`/var/lib/vaulthalla/...`), and `auth_bootstrap_state.super_admin_password_generated = TRUE` (singleton row, migration
098). Nothing re-issues it while the `admin` row exists: restarts, upgrades, reinstalls (adopt) and a deleted file
keep the password. Any change of admin's password (`auth::Manager::changePassword/resetPassword`) marks it rotated and
removes the file; a failed removal is logged and reported, never rolled back. `vh setup set-super-admin-password` is a
daemon shell command (`setup/superAdminPassword.cpp` → `ops::users::setSuperAdminPassword`) restricted to the caller
whose UID is bound to `admin` (root/system/sudo refused). Startup `retireLegacyDefaultPassword()` replaces a pre-1.8.0
`vh!adm1n` with a generated one (file written, admin's refresh tokens revoked). `vh setup nginx` (lifecycle Python)
warns while generated + file present and offers rotate / delete file / continue / cancel; non-TTY warns and continues.

### Refresh tokens and the web auth gate

Refresh tokens (human and share) are HS256 JWTs minted by `auth::session::Issuer`: a libuuid random `jti` plus an
HMAC-SHA256 signature keyed by the daemon's JWT secret (64 CSPRNG characters). Because they are high-entropy and
server-minted, `refresh_tokens.token_hash` stores `crypto::hash::tokenDigest()` = `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`, not a
password hash. `crypto::hash::verifyToken()` accepts that digest (constant-time compare) or a legacy libsodium Argon2
string written before #171; `auth::session::Validator::verifyStoredRefreshTokenHash` (used by both the ws handshake
and the HTTP `validateRawRefreshToken` path) rewrites a legacy row to the digest after a successful verify
(conditional `UPDATE`, a failed rewrite only logs). (Argon2 used to cost ~0.57 s per check on every page load and
every HTTP preview/download.) User passwords still use `crypto::hash::password()` (Argon2). No migration: the column
is `TEXT`. Guard: `RefreshTokenDigest*` unit tests.

**HTTP auth hot path.** Media seeking fires many small requests, so `session::Manager` skips the refresh-token DB
lookup for 30 s after a successful validation of the same in-memory session (`validatedAt_` keyed by jti, dropped
with the session's indexes on logout/invalidation/`revokeSessions`, so revocation stays immediate).
`rbac::policyEpoch()` is bumped by share link update/revoke/token rotation and every vault role template,
assignment and override mutation; short-lived authz caches treat an older epoch as a miss. The HTTP access layer
caches a resolved share principal for 15 s under that epoch.

`web/middleware.ts` only checks that a `refresh` cookie is present (no upstream call); the websocket session gate
decides validity (see `web-client.md`). The daemon's HTTP `GET /auth/session` remains for other clients.
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDR` no longer exists.)

### HTTP lanes (`protocols/http/`)

Routes (nginx prefixes `/preview`, `/download`, `/upload` only; never add prefixes), all cookie-authenticated
(`refresh`, or `share_refresh` with `?share=1`; no tokens in URLs): `GET /preview?vault_id&path&size&page`
(RenderedImage plans only, JPEG; `size` clamped 16-2048, default 1024; `page` 0-based; `X-Vaulthalla-Page-Count`
for PDFs; `scale` accepted and ignored), `POST /preview/batch` (≤ 200 items, per-item RBAC,
`ready|queued|missing|unsupported|error`, never fetches remote-only files), `GET|HEAD /download/content` (original
bytes, inline by default), `GET|HEAD /download` (files stream with no size cap; directories stream a STORE ZIP,
see "Folder ZIPs" below), `GET /preview/derived?kind=&variant=` (200 artifact | 202 queued + Retry-After |
415 | 422 `conversion_failed` | 503 `converter_unavailable`/`busy`), `PUT /upload/text`, `GET|HEAD /download/conflict?
conflict_id&side=local|remote` (#187, humans only: `ops::conflicts::previewTarget` = resolve_conflicts + filesystem Read;
409 when the conflict is closed; local side served like `/download/content` with remote fetch off; remote side fetched
on demand by `sync::ConflictResolver::fetchRemoteForPreview`: price preflight `conflict_preview`, a usage capture of
1 HEAD + 1 GET + the cap, If-Match the HEAD's ETag, decrypted in memory, never stored, ≤ 32 MiB (413 `too_large`),
Range ignored; HEAD answers from the recorded artifact without contacting the bucket).
- **Server.** One thread per connection, capped by `http_preview_server.max_connections` (over the cap: raw `503` +
  `Retry-After: 1`). `TimedStream` polls a non-blocking socket against real deadlines (idle keep-alive 20 s,
  read/write inactivity 60 s); `SO_RCVTIMEO` was ignored by Asio. Long streams never occupy a shared pool slot.
- **Access layer** (`Access.cpp`) is the only place a route's `Need` (Preview, Download, Overwrite) maps onto RBAC:
  humans via the vault resolver (Preview and Download → filesystem Read, + List for directory ZIPs; Overwrite →
  `FilesystemAction::Overwrite`), shares via `share::TargetResolver` with the share op. Runs before any cache lookup,
  decrypt or render; HEAD = GET. Typed `Unauthorized/Forbidden/NotFound/BadRequest` → 401/403/404/400 (no
  status-by-substring). A missing path is 404 only for callers with Read on the vault root, else 403 (no existence
  oracle). Share accounting (`recordShareAccess`) is coalesced: one audit event, and for Download needs one
  `max_downloads` unit (`share::Manager::consumeDownload`, a conditional UPDATE; refusals audited as
  `share.download.limit`, HTTP 403 `max_downloads_reached`), per share session × entry × source id × event type per
  30 min. HEAD and 304 never count. Human accesses go to the audit log channel, coalesced the same way.
- **Serving** (`handler/Common.cpp` `serve`): strong generation ETag
  (`"g<file_id>-<hex16(sha256(sourceId|key_version|size))>"`), 304, one Range (206/416, `If-Range`; multi-range or
  malformed → 200 full), open-ended ranges capped at 16 MiB for inline media, HEAD writes headers only and never opens
  the reader. Bodies are `StreamResponse`s pulled in 256 KiB chunks from a `PlaintextReader` (TCP backpressure; a
  write error stops decryption; an integrity failure mid-body truncates and closes). Every original-bytes response
  sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, `nosniff`, a sandbox CSP and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`; non-media
  originals are served inline as `application/octet-stream`. Fresh nginx sites also set `proxy_buffering off` +
  `proxy_max_temp_file_size 0` on `/preview` and `/download`; upgrades keep the old site and rely on the header.
- **Folder ZIPs** (`handler/Archive.cpp`, #143). `archive::plan` walks the folder first (one `fsCache->listDir` /
  share `listChildren` per directory, name-sorted) and authorizes every entry exactly as before (human: Read on files,
  Read + List on dirs via `access::requireHumanChild`; share: List per dir via `resolve`, Download per entry via
  `TargetResolver::resolveListedChild`: the same scope/entry/RBAC checks without reloading root and entry per entry,
  parity-tested against `resolve`; one denial → 403 for the whole archive). It reads no bytes, skips symlinks and `.upload-http-*.part` staging, and caps the plan at
  `archive::kMaxEntries` (50,000 → 413 `limit_exceeded`: bounds the walk, done for HEAD and GET, and the
  plan's ~1 KiB/entry); there is no byte cap. Members are STOREd with data
  descriptors (CRC-32 computed while streaming), ZIP64 where a size, offset or the entry count needs it, UTF-8 names
  (bit 11; invalid UTF-8, `\`, control bytes → `_`; never absolute or `..`), DOS + UT mtime. STORE + plaintext
  `files.size_bytes` make the length exact up front: GET and HEAD carry `Content-Length`, HEAD stops after the plan.
  The body is `archive::stream`, a sequential `PlaintextReader` the session pulls like a file: one member open at a
  time (≤ 1 MiB members read in one authenticated pass, larger ones streamed and `requireAuthenticated()` before
  their descriptor, so a CRC never vouches for unverified bytes); a member that fails integrity, changed size or is
  unavailable (remote-only + policy) throws mid-body → truncated response + closed connection. Share archives count
  one `max_downloads` unit per logical download on GET (never HEAD), coalesced like files (key `dir`).
- **Text saves** (`handler/Text.cpp`): human only (shares 403), TextDocument plans only, `If-Match` required (428
  without, 412 + current ETag on mismatch), UTF-8 without NUL, ≤ `preview.text.max_edit_bytes` (413). Re-seals through
  `Filesystem::createFile(overwrite, expected_source_id)`, which takes a per-file content lock
  (`contentWriteMutex(fuse_path)`) so the check is a true CAS, and throws `ContentConflict` (→ 412) when the source id
  moved or the file has an open FUSE working copy.

### Byte-serving spine, integrity and derived artifacts

- **Positioned reads.** `storage::Engine::openPlaintextReader(file, ReaderOptions)` is the single funnel for every
  byte consumer (HTTP, media, models, text, thumbnails, converter input). `storage::Generation` identifies one content
  version: `sourceId()` = IV (changes on every write; rename/move keep it), `plain:<size>:<updated_at>` for
  unencrypted legacy/empty files. `GcmFileReader` preads only the requested ciphertext and decrypts with the GCM CTR
  keystream (`crypto::util::gcmCtrDecryptAt`: plaintext offset o ↔ ciphertext offset o, counter IV‖BE32(2+o/16)).
  Keys come from `EncryptionManager::keySnapshot(version)` (immutable `crypto::SecretKey`, mlocked, wiped; rotation
  swaps pointers under a shared_mutex). `readAll()` does one authenticated pass and records the verdict.
- **Verify-once integrity.** `crypto::IntegrityRegistry` keys a verdict on (domain, IV, key version, dev, ino, size,
  mtime_ns) and runs one streaming tag check per key on 2 workers (capacity 8192 settled verdicts). `optimistic`
  (default, `preview.media.integrity`) serves at once and every live reader throws `IntegrityError` on its next read
  after a failed verdict; `strict` waits for the verdict. Failure is sticky for that key (later opens fail fast;
  logged on the crypto channel); a replacement during verification is `Superseded`, not corruption.
- **Remote-only files** (cloud vaults without a local copy) follow `preview.media.remote`: `hydrate` (default: whole
  object once, metered/budgeted, verified, local ciphertext kept), `ranged` (opt-in metered ranged GETs pinned to the
  object version, no per-range authentication), `off` (`storage::ContentUnavailable` → HTTP 503
  `content_unavailable`). Grid thumbnails always use `off`. Chunked AEAD at rest would only be needed for
  *authenticated* random access to remote-only objects.
- **Derived cache** (`preview::cache::Store`, `cache_index` rows `type='derived'`, migration 103). One encrypted,
  disposable cache for thumbnails (`thumbnail`/`<size>`), sheet and PDF page renders (`render`/`p<page>-s<size>`),
  posters, probes, GLB, transcodes. File: `<cacheRoot>/derived/<file_id>/<kind>.<variant>.vhd` = 64-byte header
  (`VHDERIV1`, header version, key version, IV) ‖ AES-256-GCM(vault key, fresh IV, AAD = header ‖
  `"<vault>/<file>/<kind>/<variant>/<source_id>/<generator_version>"`) ‖ tag; 0600 temp, fsync, rename. Valid only
  for the current source id, generator version and a resolvable key version; anything else is deleted on sight.
  Failures are negative-cached (`preview.derive.failure_ttl_hours`, or until the source changes). LRU eviction to
  `caching.max_size_mb`, idle expiry `caching.thumbnails.expiry_days`, per-file/vault purge, retired-key purge after
  rotation, startup sweep. Not charged to vault quotas (`Engine::getCacheSize` excludes `derived/`); never synced,
  never visible over FUSE.
- **Render pipeline** (`preview::render::{Raster,Service}`). Header-checked decodes against
  `preview.max_render_pixels` and `http_preview_server.max_preview_size_mb`; TurboJPEG DCT-scaled decode, stb from
  memory otherwise; PDF pages behind one process-wide PDFium lock (`PdfiumLibrary` is the one init/teardown, held by
  `main` and test suites), rendered by PDFium straight into the packed RGB raster (24bpp + `FPDF_REVERSE_BYTE_ORDER`); output edges ≤ 2048, never upscaled. Thumbnails
  decode once and resize down a chain for every `caching.thumbnails.sizes` entry (16-2048). A render gate bounds CPU
  (`render::Busy` → 503 + Retry-After). Uploads hand their in-memory plaintext to thumbnailing. A derived-cache outage
  degrades to uncached renders. Preview plans (`preview::classify`, file JSON `"preview"`, see `web-client.md`) decide
  which files render at all; `caching.thumbnails.formats` is no longer read.
- **Derive queue** (`preview::derive::Queue`, HTTP `/preview/derived`): bounded (`preview.derive.max_queue`),
  `max_concurrency` workers, deduplicated per artifact key, feeding `Runner` (below) into a `Store::Writer`.

### FUSE

`core/src/fuse/Service.cpp` validates the mountpoint, mounts a low-level session with `allow_other,auto_unmount`
(subtype `vaulthalla-fuse`), and dispatches to a thread pool. Mount path: `/mnt/vaulthalla` (prod/dev),
`/tmp/vh_mount` (integration harness).
- **FUSE ops hit the DB.** If the DB pool wedges, every FUSE op on the mount hangs, including
  `stat`, `mountpoint`, and `df`. See P0 in `production-hardening.md`.
- HTTP uploads stage `.upload-http-<id>-<file>.part` next to the target *through FUSE*, then rename
  from `fuse_from` to `fuse_to` (`http/upload/Coordinator.cpp`). This is intentional. Don't move staging out of
  FUSE to reduce sync churn; fix duplicate sync triggers or backing-path resolution instead.
- **Vault bytes are always ciphertext at rest; the mount is the decrypting view (#173).** Every backing file (local
  vaults and cloud vaults' local copies) is AES-256-GCM body‖16-byte tag, IV and key version in `files`, and
  `files.size_bytes` is the *plaintext* size. Derived preview artifacts are encrypted too (`VHDERIV1`, see
  "Byte-serving spine"); the legacy plaintext `<cacheRoot>/thumbnails` and `<cacheRoot>/files` trees are deleted by
  `preview::cache::Store::sweep` at startup. The HTTP lanes never write plaintext. FUSE `open` decrypts into a
  per-inode working copy
  (`fuse/WorkingCopies`, 0600 under `<backing>/.fuse-plaintext`, shared by every handle on the inode); reads and
  writes go to it; `flush` (so `close(2)` returns with the change on disk), `fsync` and the last `release` seal it
  back (new IV, fsynced temp + rename). `setattr` size works on the copy. Copies that fail to seal move to
  `.fuse-plaintext/unsaved/`; stale copies are deleted at mount. A same-vault rename only moves the bytes (no
  re-encryption). `Filesystem::repairAtRest` (first sync pass per vault per start) seals plaintext left by older
  builds and corrects ciphertext-length sizes.
- **Vault key rotation is failure- and crash-safe (`sync/rotation/`).** `vh vault keys rotate` only prepares a new
  key; the sync pass re-encrypts. Per file: new ciphertext → `<backing>.vh-rotate` (O_EXCL, fsync file + dir) →
  (cloud, encrypt upstream) PUT with its own IV/version metadata → compare-and-set the `files` row on the old
  IV/version → rename over the backing file + dir fsync → fs cache refreshed. Recovery (each pass, and once per vault
  per start before `repairAtRest`) keeps whichever of sidecar/backing authenticates under the row (streaming GCM
  verify, no plaintext written) and leaves both if neither does. Remote-only files are re-encrypted remotely, never
  written locally; an uploaded-but-uncommitted object is adopted from its metadata. The rotation finishes (old key
  dropped) only when no file failed, no sidecar is unresolved and re-querying `getFilesOlderThanKeyVersion` (rows
  with an IV only: empty/legacy-plaintext files are excluded) is empty; otherwise both keys stay loaded and the next
  pass retries. Files open in FUSE are deferred. `fs::ops::replaceFileAtomic`/`writeFileAtomic` (temp + fsync +
  rename + dir fsync) back `Filesystem::createFile`'s overwrite branch. A copy (ws `fs.entry.copy`) copies the sealed
  bytes with their IV under the same content lock (see "Delete keeps folders; copy is deep" below).
- No writeback cache (`FUSE_CAP_WRITEBACK_CACHE` off): with it the kernel owns `i_size` and ignores getattr sizes,
  so out-of-band changes showed stale `stat` sizes. Handles are `direct_io` anyway.
- `forget` does not evict the metadata cache (it is seeded at startup and updated by the daemon's own changes);
  evicting a vault root used to make the whole vault ENOENT until restart.
- The RBAC gate is unchanged in shape: `open` needs Read for readable handles and Write for writable or `O_TRUNC`
  ones (both for `O_RDWR`); `write` and size changes check Write *before* touching the copy. A working copy is only
  reachable through a handle that passed the resolver.
- **Denied means hidden unless visible (#170).** `fuse::resolver::deniedErrno` answers a denial with ENOENT when the
  caller cannot Lookup the target (the parent for a create of a new name) and EACCES when it can see it but lacks
  the action; the mount root is never hidden. The answer must not depend on which op reaches the daemon first.
  An ENOENT answer to a revalidating lookup (or unlink) makes the kernel invalidate that shared dentry, so allowed
  users re-look it up, and a process whose cwd was that dentry gets ENOENT from getcwd.
- **No kernel metadata caching (#183).** The kernel dentry/attr cache is shared across uids and the mount has no
  `default_permissions`, so anything cached is answered for any caller without the daemon. Every reply uses
  `kKernelMetadataTimeout` = 0 (Bridge.cpp; pinned by `tools/contracts/test_fuse_cache_timeout_contract.py`), so each
  lookup/getattr is authorized for the calling uid. Before, a denied uid could `stat` a path another uid had just
  resolved (up to 60 s after a create). Size coherence doesn't need kernel caching: `statFromEntry` reports an open
  working copy's size. The harness passing "override allow: read secret" had relied on that cache: a file Lookup
  maps to Preview, so a download-only grant was hidden; `Evaluator::resolveStage` now lets a denied file Lookup fall
  back to the Read decision (seeing a file is implied by being allowed to download it).

## Database

- PostgreSQL via libpqxx. The schema is `deploy/psql/000…107_*.sql`, applied in order (all in ONE transaction by `core/seed/include/SqlDeployer.hpp`) and installed to `/usr/share/vaulthalla/psql`.
  New migrations take the next number and must be idempotent against upgraded installs. SqlDeployer records sha256(raw bytes)
  per file and refuses to start on a mismatch, so **never edit a shipped migration**: 020/060/082 were edited in place and
  bricked upgrades (1.5.x→1.6.x crash loop on 060). Reviewed exceptions live in `kHistoricalMigrationChecksums` (accepted, recorded
  hash rewritten to current, not re-run; a forward migration owns the delta). `core/seed/shipped_migrations.lock` pins every hash;
  `tools/contracts/test_migration_checksums_contract.py` enforces it (plus every local v* tag).
- `core/include/db/DBPool.hpp` is a fixed pool of 4 connections (config `database.pool_size` is **not** wired to it)
  handed out as RAII `DBPool::Lease`s (FIFO) that always return the slot. A dead connection is replaced on
  `acquire()` (reconnect + re-prepare, pool-wide backoff 250ms→5s, callers inside the window get
  `DatabaseUnavailable`). "Dead" also covers a session poisoned by a libpqxx error
  (`pqxx::failure::poisons_connection()`: unknown COMMIT outcome, protocol violation), which `Transactions::exec`
  marks. `acquire()` throws `PoolAcquireTimeout` after 30s. `db::Connection` hands libpq keyword/value parameters
  (no assembled or URI-escaped connection string): `connect_timeout=10`, `application_name=vaulthalla`, and TCP
  keepalives (30s idle, 10s × 3) + `tcp_user_timeout=60000`, so a server that stops answering surfaces as a broken
  connection within about a minute.
- libpqxx 8 rows: models and mappers take `pqxx::row_ref` / `pqxx::field_ref` **by value**; they are views into a
  `pqxx::result` and never keep it alive. Name the result before taking a row from it (`const auto res =
  txn.exec(...); res.one_row_ref()`); a `row_ref` from `txn.exec(...)[0]` in a declaration dangles. Only an owning
  `one_row()` may outlive its result. `db/Rows.hpp` maps results (`db::sharedRows<T>`, `db::rowsAs<T>`,
  `db::mapRows(res, fn)`); enums bound as parameters go through their SQL text (`to_string`).
  `core/include/db/Transactions.hpp` has `Transactions::exec(ctx, fn)`, the only path to a `pqxx::work`. It
  reconnects and retries once only when BEGIN fails on a dead connection (before `fn` runs); later failures
  surface. Pool state is in `SystemHealth.database` (`vh status`, stats ws, watchdog). Queries live in
  `core/src/db/query/<domain>/`, prepared statements in `core/src/db/preparedStatements/`.
- **Time zones (#157):** every daemon session runs with `TimeZone=UTC` (`db::Connection::configureSession`, on connect
  and reconnect) and records the zone it started in as `vaulthalla.database_timezone`. Migration 100 converted every
  `timestamp` column to `timestamptz`, reading old values in that recorded zone (manual psql runs fall back to the
  session zone); columns a view depends on are skipped with a warning. New columns must be `TIMESTAMPTZ`. Text output
  is `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.ffffff]+00`, which `db::encoding::parsePostgresTimestamp` handles. Guard: `DbTimezoneTest`.
- `db::Janitor` handles sweeps (DB cleanup every `services.db_sweeper.sweep_interval_minutes`, derived-artifact
  eviction every 15 min). Stats rollups read from `file_activity`, `files_trashed`, `operations`, `share_*`.

**Config keys renamed or moved (#164).** `config.yaml` is never rewritten on upgrade, so `loadConfig` keeps reading
the old spellings: `sharing.enable_public_links` → `sharing.enable_email_validated`, and
`s3_gateway.default_remote_{sync_strategy,conflict_policy}` → `vaults.s3.*` (new key wins; an invalid old value is
ignored; an invalid new value refuses to start). It collects one message per old key and `main.cpp` logs them via
`config::Registry::deprecations()` after the log registry is up (config loads before logging). `Config::save`
writes only the new keys, so a console save migrates the file. The settings JSON accepts the old spellings when the
new ones are absent. `ops::vaults::create` starts S3 policies from `vaults.s3.*` (CLI interactive prompts offer the
same defaults); gateway remote-cache buckets stay explicit `cache` + `keep_local`. Since #187 the remote default is
`ask` (conflicts are resolvable; see "Sync conflicts" below); existing vaults keep their stored policy.
`settings.policy.get` (any signed-in user) returns `{policy: {sharing, vaults}}`; `settings.get` stays super admin only.

### Converter helpers (`core/tools`, `preview::derive`)

Hostile-file converters never run in the daemon. `core/tools/` builds separate executables (own meson targets,
options `preview_cad`/`preview_media`, packages `vaulthalla-preview-{cad,media}`, installed to
`/usr/lib/vaulthalla/helpers/`); `core/tools/common` (protocol + Landlock/seccomp sandbox, libseccomp) links only
into them. `preview::derive::Runner` (`core/{include,src}/preview/derive/`) spawns one helper per job: fork
(`_Fork`) + async-signal-safe child setup (setsid, PDEATHSIG, NO_NEW_PRIVS, rlimits AS/CPU/FSIZE=0/NOFILE/CORE, fds
0-4 only, empty env), a poll loop that serves range-pull requests on fd 3 from a `storage::PlaintextReader`,
streams fd 1 to a sink, enforces the output cap and wall timeout (SIGKILL of the process group) and reaps.
Helper exit/JSON contract: `core/tools/common/protocol.hpp`. Config: `preview.derive.*`. RLIMIT_NPROC is not
set (per-UID; the daemon's threads would count): process creation is denied by the helper's seccomp filter, the
CAD helper denies clone outright, and the runner SIGKILLs a helper whose thread count (/proc/<pid>/stat, sampled
every 20 ms poll tick) exceeds `Limits::maxThreads` (64; limit_exceeded). Each poll iteration reads a bounded
amount per pipe (stderr/result one chunk, stdout 1 MiB), so a flooding helper cannot starve the deadline checks.
Helpers refuse to run (exit 5, `sandbox_unavailable`, queue reports `converter_unavailable`) without BOTH Landlock
and seccomp; the seccomp filter also limits pid-taking syscalls (prlimit64, setpriority, ioprio_set, sched_set*,
move/migrate_pages) to self, denies fcntl F_SETOWN/F_SETOWN_EX/F_SETSIG/F_SETLEASE and ioctl FIOSETOWN/SIOCSPGRP
(low-32-bit masked), SysV IPC and POSIX mqueues; the CAD `selftest-sandbox` command exercises every vector. Media
hardware devices are opened only after the sandbox (Landlock is per-thread). Trust: `Runner` executes only
root-owned, non-group/world-writable helpers in such directories (canonical path checked and executed;
`setTrustChecksForTesting(false)` in gtest_main, honoured only in testMode); `preview.derive.helper_dir` is
read-only through `ops::config::validateSettings` (settings.update/CLI).
Tests: `test_derive_runner.cpp` (fake helper `core/tests/helpers/fake_derive_helper.cpp`),
`test_preview_cad_helper.cpp` (real helper, skipped when not built).
`RunRequest::stop` (a `std::stop_token`) SIGKILLs the process group on request (`failureReason() == "cancelled"`).

### Derived-artifact cache and derive queue (`preview::cache`, `preview::derive::Queue`)

- One encrypted cache for every derived artifact (thumbnails, page renders, posters, GLB, transcodes):
  `preview::cache::Store`, files `<cacheRoot>/derived/<file_id>/<kind>.<variant>.vhd` (VHDERIV1 header + AES-256-GCM
  under the vault key, identity bound as AAD), rows in `cache_index` (`type='derived'`, migration 103) keyed by
  `(file_id, kind, variant)` and valid only for the source generation (`Generation::sourceId()`, the file IV) and
  generator version. `status='failed'` rows are the negative cache (`preview.derive.failure_ttl_hours`).
- Artifacts are keyed by **file id**, never by path: rename/move need nothing; a file id that ends (delete, trash,
  purge, S3 gateway delete, FUSE unlink) calls `Engine::purgeDerivedArtifacts(fileId)` (best effort, logs); a vault
  removal calls `Store::purgeVault` (`storage::Manager::removeVault`). The old path-keyed
  `Engine::{purge,move,copy}Thumbnails` helpers are gone; don't reintroduce path-keyed cache files.
- `preview::derive::Queue` (`Queue.cpp`) sits in front of Runner + Store: `request(engine, file, kind)` never blocks
  on conversion. Kind table (helper, command, args, generator version) is `queue_impl::kKinds`; bump a kind's
  generator version when its output changes. Flow: kind known + listed in the file's `PreviewPlan::derived` (transcodes
  not with `preview.media.transcode: off`, variant `v1`) else Unsupported → helper executable else Unavailable → `Store::lookup` Ready/Failed → in-flight key ⇒ Queued →
  `preview.derive.max_queue` pending ⇒ Busy → enqueue. `max_concurrency` `std::jthread` workers start lazily.
  A job re-checks the DB generation before opening, streams `openPlaintextReader` into the helper and the helper
  into a `Store::Writer`, and commits only if the generation is still current. Deterministic failures
  (invalid_input, limit_exceeded, unsupported, crashed, timeout) are negatively cached; transient ones
  (content_unavailable, integrity, internal, protocol, cancelled, helper missing) are only remembered for 30 s so
  pollers see Failed instead of polling forever. `Queue::shutdown()` (main, after `stopRuntime`) cancels running
  helpers via the stop token and joins.
- Lifecycle hooks (`preview/cache/Maintenance.hpp`): `applyConfig()` at boot (reader integrity/remote defaults,
  failure TTL); `sweepAtStartup()` after `initStorageEngines()` on every start (deletes legacy plaintext
  `<cacheRoot>/thumbnails`, orphan artifact dirs, temp files); `db::Janitor` runs `evictPeriodic()` every 15 min
  (LRU to `caching.max_size_mb`, idle expiry `caching.thumbnails.expiry_days`) independent of its DB sweep cadence;
  a finished key rotation (`sync::Local::handleVaultKeyRotation`) calls `Store::purgeRetiredKeys`.
- Tests: `test_preview_store.cpp`, `test_derive_queue.cpp` (DB-backed, fake helper symlinked under both helper
  names; real CAD helper when built).

### `ops/`: shared command operations

`core/{include,src}/ops/` holds plain free functions with typed request structs, one file pair per family
(`ops::groups`, `ops::roles`, ...). Each op takes the acting `User` (`ops::Actor`, null → `ops::Denied`), authorizes, looks up,
validates, persists, and returns domain objects. Refusals are typed `ops::Error`s (`Denied`, `NotFound`, `Invalid`,
`Conflict`, and `NeedsConfirmation{code}` for "a person must accept this first", e.g. the encryption waiver). The CLI
handler parses with `CommandUsage` and calls the op through `shell::runOp`, which maps `ops::Error` to exit 2 (CLI
waiver prompts go through `shell::commands::vault::runWithWaiver`). The ws handler maps its payload to the request,
and every ws handler template (`protocols/ws/core/handler_templates.hpp`, `describeCurrentError`) turns the exception into
an `ERROR` response whose `data.code` is stable: `denied`, `not_found`, `invalid`, `conflict`, or the `NeedsConfirmation`
code (the web asks and resends with `accept_encryption_waiver`); a non-`ops::Error` fault has no code. Handler-level
gates (settings/email/pricing admin checks, share upload scope) throw `ops::Denied` so they carry `denied`; every
`stats.*` command authorizes through `ops::stats` (below). Rules: RBAC for an operation lives in the op, never in the frontend as well; code beneath
`ops::` (managers, `db::query`) never authorizes; internal callers use those primitives directly, not ops; no
registry, base class or transport abstraction. Parity is proven by `test_ops_parity_groups.cpp`, which runs each
group operation through both surfaces for every seeded admin role and compares verdicts and DB state.
Migrated families (each with `test_ops_parity_<family>.cpp`): `groups`, `roles`, `api_keys`, `vaults` (lifecycle,
safe deletion/restore, sync policy), `users`, `s3_gateway` (credentials, grants, buckets, credential budgets), `pricing` (price budget
policies), `config` (every settings write: one validation, one apply step that restarts the S3 gateway when
`s3_gateway.enabled` changes), `stats` (authorization only, ws-only: there is no `vh` stats command; `vh status`
is deliberately ungated, see Stats below), `conflicts` (sync conflicts, #187: ws `sync.conflicts.*`, `vh sync resolve` /
`vh resolve`, the HTTP `/download/conflict` lane's authorization). Still per-surface: the ws-only pricing preflight/override/notification endpoints,
email test-send/history, vault keys/sync diagnostics, and lifecycle commands (`setup`, `teardown`, `secrets`).

Rules the families hold (keep them in ops, never re-add them in a handler):
- **Users:** an account is an *admin identity* when its admin role grants anything outside the self scopes
  (`ops::users::isAdminIdentity`, which counts `admin.stats.view` too); that, not `User::isAdmin()` (a strict "full
  admin" test kept for S3 policy bypass and the resolvers' owner scope), picks admins.* vs users.* identity
  permissions. The ceiling applies to assignment *and* to managing an
  account above you (edit, delete, reset password). Deletion, deactivation, role change and password reset call
  `auth::Manager::revokeSessions` (refresh tokens revoked, live sessions invalidated). `auth::Manager` has no user cache.
- **API keys:** `update` edits in place (keeps the id, so `s3` rows survive; an empty secret keeps the sealed one;
  `KeyPerm::Edit`), re-validates credentials outside test mode and reloads the engines of the vaults using the key
  (`storage::Manager::reloadEngine`). `remove` refuses (`Invalid`, naming the vaults) while any `s3` row references the
  key, and `ops::users::remove` refuses up front when a surviving vault uses one of the account's keys. Backed by
  `s3.api_key_id ... ON DELETE RESTRICT` (migration 099; it was CASCADE and silently dropped bindings).
- **Vaults:** every change goes through `storage::Manager::updateVault` so the live engine (RBAC's source of the owner)
  follows; owner reassignment needs Create for the new owner; a key change needs Consume; sync settings need vault
  `sync.config.edit`.
- **S3 gateway:** the scope rule that was `CredentialManager::validateScopeMutation` is `requireScopeMutation` in ops;
  `CredentialManager` and `db::query::s3::Gateway` are trusted primitives. Vault names resolve owner-scoped or uniquely,
  never to the first match. Overrides need an explicit effect and pattern. Remote-cache buckets are created through
  `ops::vaults::create` (Consume, waiver) and rolled back if the bind fails.
- **Health:** `stats::model::SystemHealth::snapshot()` takes a bounded live DB probe; an unreachable database is
  critical there, so `vh status` and `stats.system.health` report the same severity.
- **Lists:** `ListQueryParams::sort` must be a column name (`isSortColumn`); it lands in ORDER BY.

**Role permissions (one mechanism).** Every permission change goes through
`PermissionResolver::applyChanges(role, exported, [(qualified, grant)], complete)`, which reports unknown names, missing
snapshot values and unapplicable permissions instead of skipping them. The CLI translates `--allow-*`/`--deny-*`
(the short flags `vh permission` prints, from each set's `flagPrefix()`) into that delta via
`shell/util/permissionFlags.hpp`; the web sends a complete `{qualified, value}` snapshot. The resolver only dispatches
a permission if its target trait (`TargetTraits.hpp`) or context policy (`policy/*.hpp`, included by `EnumPack.hpp`)
is visible; `test_role_permissions.cpp` round-trips every exported permission so a missing trait can't silently
no-op again. `ops::roles` enforces the escalation ceiling: nobody grants an admin permission they do not hold
(`permissionsBeyondActor`). Vault-role overrides persist through `db::query::rbac::permission::Override` on the
subject's assignment; both `vh vault role override ...` and ws `role.vault.overrides.{list,add,update,remove}` call
`ops::roles::*VaultRoleOverride*` (parity in `test_ops_parity_roles.cpp`).

## Subsystem invariants (enforced in code, keep them)

**Filesystem RBAC paths, FS cache and account deletion** (#178–#180, `VaultLifecycleRegressionTest`)
- `rbac::resolver::vault::Context::path` (and `fs::policy::Request::path`) is a **FUSE** path. Callers holding a vault
  path convert it with `engine->vaultPathToFusePath()` first; `share::Manager` once didn't, so only share root `/`
  ever passed and a vault path equal to another vault's FUSE root resolved to that vault. The evaluator refuses an
  entry whose `vault_id` differs from the request's vault (`EntryVaultMismatch`).
- The FS cache is keyed by FUSE path and can only re-hydrate a vault root through `mkVault` (or the rename path in
  `storage::Manager::updateVault`). `storage::Manager` calls `fs::cache::Registry::evictVault` on remove, on rename
  (old and new root, then re-caches the root) and in `addVault` *before* the engine creates the root. Evicting after
  `mkVault` would drop the fresh root and the whole vault would answer ENOENT.
- Every `users(id)` reference has a delete action (migration 104): attribution/audit columns `SET NULL`, while
  `file_locks.locked_by` and `share_link.created_by` `CASCADE` (a deleted account's public links die with it). New
  tables referencing `users` must pick one; a bare `REFERENCES users` blocks `vh user delete`.

**Delete keeps folders; copy is deep and readable at once** (#168, #167; `FsDirStatsDbTest`, `FsCopyDbTest`, harness
stage "Copy And Delete")
- Deleting a file never removes its parent folders, on every path: ws `fs.entry.delete`, FUSE unlink, the S3 gateway
  (DeleteObject, local purge), sync DeleteLocal and trash purge. `File::updateParentStats` only takes the file off
  every ancestor's totals (it was `updateParentStatsAndCleanEmptyDirs`, which deleted ancestors left without files
  except on FUSE calls, so the console and the mount disagreed). The S3 view still loses an implicit prefix with its
  last object: ListObjects derives CommonPrefixes from object keys, not folder rows, and `bucketIsEmpty` counts files
  only. A folder goes only when it is what's deleted. FUSE rmdir refuses a non-empty folder (ENOTEMPTY, including
  children the caller can't see; it used to cascade-delete them) and takes the folder off every ancestor's count.
  Trash purge removes only the file's backing path.
- `Filesystem::copy(CopyContext)`: plan (source subtree from the DB via `Entry::listSubtree`; `Entry::listDir(id, true)`
  returns only direct child files/symlinks and seeds the startup cache in that shape) → `authorize` every entry
  (ws: Copy + Read on each source file, Write/Touch at each destination) → quota (`freeSpace`) → bytes (outside
  `mutex_`): each file's sealed backing bytes are copied as-is to `<dest parent backing>/<new alias>` under the
  source's content lock, with the row snapshot taken under that lock (same IV, key version, plaintext size, content
  hash; no AAD, and any later write draws a fresh IV, so the shared (key, IV) only ever sealed that plaintext; a
  corrupted source stays detectable). Cloud files without a local copy are hydrated first (metered,
  price-preflighted); the next sync uploads the copy as a new object (one PUT each, planned and price-checked like any
  upload). → rows under `mutex_`, shallowest first, so totals build up entry by entry. Any failure takes back rows and
  bytes. The sync pass no longer replays `operations` rows (`Local::processOperations` wrote to the pre-alias
  `BACKING_VAULT_ROOT/<vault path>` layout and nothing had queued a pending row since 2025); the table records activity.

**Safe vault deletion with retention** (#162, migration 106, `vault/Retention.*`, `vault/RetentionService.*`,
`db/query/vault/Deletion.*`, `VaultRetentionTest`, `VaultParityTest.DeletionLifecycleAgreesOnBothSurfaces`)
- A delete is a schedule (`ops::vaults::remove` → `vault::retention::schedule`): one transaction sets
  `vault.deleted_at`, detaches the vault root (`fs_entry.parent_id = NULL`), nulls the vault's inodes, copies every key
  version (still TPM-sealed) into `vault_deletion_key` and writes the `vault_deletion` record (purge_after,
  key_retain_until, delete_upstream); then `storage::Manager::retireVault` drops the engine, evicts the FS cache, purges
  derived artifacts and refreshes sync. Read paths filter deleted vaults: `get_vault*`, `listVaults/listUserVaults`, share
  link statements, S3 gateway bucket resolve/list. `vault_exists`, slug/FUSE-name uniqueness and the `s3` binding still
  see them: **the name, slug, FUSE name and bucket stay reserved until the purge** (`ops::vaults::create` says how to
  restore or purge). Restore (pending only) re-attaches the root and rebuilds the engine (`reinstateVault`; descendants get
  inodes lazily). Restore and the purge claim the same row (`DELETE … WHERE state='pending'` vs `UPDATE … SET
  state='purging'`), so they never both win.
- `VaultRetentionService` (30 s, or at once after "delete now") runs `retention::runPass(now)`: claims due records,
  deletes upstream objects when chosen (≤ 10 LIST pages / 10 000 DELETEs per pass via `Controller::listObjectKeysPage`,
  resumable, refused when the binding is gone or another vault uses the same bucket+endpoint+region: the purge then
  finishes locally with a note), removes the backing and cache dirs through `removeVaultDirectory` (alias must be one
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` name, a real directory directly under the resolved root, never a symlink), then deletes the vault row
  (`finishPurge`, only `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`). Failures retry with backoff (30 s → 1 h). Key copies are dropped when
  `key_retain_until` passes; the tombstone row stays. "Delete now" never shortens the key window.
- RBAC: delete, delete now, restore and listing need vault Remove; a deleted vault has no engine, so the admin resolver
  takes `admin::Context::vault` (built from the record's owner). Export tracking: `vault_keys.exported_version/at`
  (set by `vh vault keys export`; a rotation makes it stale). NeedsConfirmation codes `vault_upstream_key_loss` (S3,
  encrypted objects kept, key never exported) and `vault_delete_now`. `storage::Manager::removeVault` stays the
  immediate hard delete (create rollbacks, empty S3-gateway buckets) and now removes the backing dirs too.
- An account whose API keys are bound to any vault (deleted ones included, until purged) cannot be deleted.
- A vault role assigned only on deleted vaults is not in use (`count_vault_role_assignments_by_role_id` joins live
  vaults): deleting it cascades those assignments, and a restore brings the vault back without them.

**Sync conflicts** (#187, migration 107, `sync/model/Baseline.*`, `db/query/sync/Conflict.*`, `sync/ConflictResolver.*`,
`ops/Conflicts.*`; `SyncConflictsTest`, `ConflictParityTest`, `SqlDeployerHistoryDb.SyncConflictMigration*`)
- One open (`resolution = 'unresolved'`) row per file (`uq_sync_conflicts_open_file`). `sync::Cloud::initBins` loads the
  vault's baselines and open conflicts; the Planner decides; `Cloud::flushConflictState` (via `planPass`) writes them
  in one transaction before anything executes. An open row's artifacts are refreshed in place only when a side
  changed. Closed as `kept_local|kept_remote` (a decision, or the policy once it is no longer `ask`), `converged` (both
  sides agree again), `superseded` (remote side gone; duplicates closed by 107). `event_id` is the first run that saw
  it and is `ON DELETE SET NULL` (event retention no longer deletes open conflicts). Auto-resolved conflicts under
  `keep_*` stay per-event history rows (`sync_conflict.upsert`); `Event::upsert` skips unresolved ones.
- **Detection under `ask` is two-sided only.** `files.content_hash` is blake2b of the *sealed* backing file, so a
  download re-sealed under a fresh IV never hashes like the object it came from, and `hasPotentialConflict` (size or
  hash differ) fires on any one-sided edit. `sync_file_baseline` records each side's identity when they last agreed
  (local hash/size; remote index hash, ETag, size), written on agreement (`Cloud::noteInSync`) and after every
  successful upload/download/index refresh (`sync::tasks::recordBaseline`) and resolution. `Baseline::classify`:
  LocalOnly → Upload, RemoteOnly → Download (archive tier skipped), InSync → nothing, Both or Unknown (no baseline) →
  conflict. `keep_*` policies are unchanged (they still treat any difference as theirs to settle). Known pre-existing
  churn (from reading the code, no test): under `keep_remote`/`keep_newest` a file downloaded from another writer's
  object differs by hash on the next pass and is downloaded again (not changed here).
- **Resolution** (`ConflictResolver::resolve`, trusted; `ops::conflicts::resolve` authorizes per item): the local row
  must still match the local artifact and one HEAD must still match the remote artifact (ETag, else content-hash
  metadata, else size, + 16 for GCM when encrypted), else `ConflictStale` (status `conflict`). keep_local =
  `CloudEngine::upload` + `applyRemoteIndexMutation`; keep_remote = `fetchRemotePlaintext` (streamObject, If-Match the
  HEAD's ETag, the object's own vh-iv/key version adopted from the HEAD) + `replaceLocalContent` (createFile with
  `expected_source_id` = the checked generation: a true CAS against FUSE/HTTP writes). Price preflight
  `conflict_resolve` (Planner estimate + the HEAD), per-thread `ScopedS3RequestUsageCapture` under the vault's
  request budget (never the engine-wide budget a running pass owns), no FS/DB lock across network work, then one
  transaction closes the row and records the baseline. One in-flight decision per conflict per process.
- **Who:** `vault.sync.action.resolve_conflicts` (sync action bit 2 = mask bit 10) **plus** filesystem Overwrite on the
  file (Read for previews). `ops::conflicts::canResolveIn` = the vault resolver (owner self scope, admin vault globals)
  OR a vault role on that vault (the account's or a group's). The vault resolver itself only reads vault globals for
  sync/roles permissions, so vault-role `sync.action.trigger`/`sign_waiver` are still not honoured anywhere (gap, not
  changed here). Lists/summary include only vaults the actor can resolve in; deleted vaults are excluded.

**Operator email** (`email/`, `notifications/`, `085_operator_notifications.sql`, `vh email …`)
- Provider secrets are encrypted in `internal_secrets` and entered by hidden prompt. They never go in `.env` or files, and are never logged or rendered.
  Secret reveal was deliberately removed (`a7cc2f4b`).
- If email is disabled, the server must still report healthy. Security alerts are enqueued only after a successful DB write
  and never block the mutation. `Manager::startWatchdog()` stays restart-only.

**Stats / dashboards** (26 `stats.*` ws commands, `dashboard.preferences.*`)
- **Who may read (#166, `ops::stats`).** System stats (overview, severity, health, thread pools, FUSE, DB, operations,
  connections, storage, retention, trends, FS/HTTP caches, system pricing totals) need the admin permission
  `admin.stats.view` (module `admin.stats`, `admin_role.stats_permissions` BIT(8), bit 0; migration 105 added the
  column and granted it to `admin`, `auditor`, `platform_operator`, `super_admin` and any role that passed the old
  `isAdmin()` gate). Vault-scoped stats (`stats.vault.*`, `stats.pricing.budget {vault_id}`) are open to the vault's
  owner or an admin role with `admin.vaults.<scope>.view` + `view_stats` on it; vault-role members who don't own the
  vault are not enough (activity/share/security stats ignore path overrides). Missing and forbidden vaults refuse
  alike. `vh status` is not gated: it skips the DB user lookup so it works while PostgreSQL is down. Guard:
  `test_stats_access.cpp` (`StatsPermission*`, `StatsAccessTest`), `RoleParityTest.StatsView*`,
  `SqlDeployerHistoryDb.StatsPermissionMigration*`.
- **Payload contract (#160).** Trends read `stats_metric_rollup` for every window (5-minute buckets up to 7 d, hourly
  beyond; rollups are upserted with each sample batch), so 24 h never returns more points than 7 d. Overview hrefs are
  console routes (`/health/*`, `/cost#…`); counts carry `numeric_value`; money carries `numeric_value` + the ISO
  currency as `unit`, or `"unknown"`/null when not measured. `PriceBudgetDashboardStats.{current,projected}_monthly_spend`
  are null without a monthly window. A cache with no byte cap (the FS metadata cache) reports
  `capacity_bytes`/`free_bytes` null; the preview cache reports `caching.max_size_mb` from boot. Cards carry at most
  `kDashboardOverviewMaxSeriesPerCard` (3) series of `kDashboardOverviewMaxPointsPerSeries` (64) points.
- The backend owns severity, warning, and error truth. Never show fake integrity, recoverability, or latency badges; report
  unavailable values as `null` / `"not_available"`.
- Stats commands are read-only, and snapshots are background-only. Preferences are scoped to `session->user->id`.
- `stats.dashboard.severity` (nav badge) returns `{stats: {overall_status, error_count, warning_count, checked_at}}` from
  `DashboardOverview::severity()`: the same default cards and aggregation as the overview, without trend series or
  sections, and without serializing cards.
- Rationale history: `history/stats-dashboard.md`.

**S3 pricing / cost estimates** (`core/{include,src}/storage/s3/pricing/`)
- Prices come from the **price bot**, a separate repo (`github.com/vaulthalla/vaulthalla-price-bot`, checked out at
  `/srv/vaulthalla-price-bot`, DB `vaulthalla_price_bot` on dev-db). It fetches official provider pricing, normalizes it,
  and publishes **Ed25519-signed** artifacts (`price-bot publish` / `mirror-artifacts`), served under `/v1/artifacts/`.
- Core `PriceBotClient` fetches `/v1/artifacts/manifest.json` plus the artifacts, verifies signatures with libsodium
  (`verifyEd25519Pem`), and caches under `<backing path>/price-cache`. `PriceCatalogStore` tries the primary source,
  then `fallback_artifact_base_urls`. `PriceEstimate` feeds price budgets (`091`–`094_s3_price_*.sql`).
- Config: `pricing.storage_rates_api` (`base_url: https://storage-rates-api.vaulthalla.cloud`,
  `remote_refresh_enabled: false` in the shipped config, `fail_open: true`, 12h cache/refresh). A local dev price bot
  runs on `127.0.0.1:36933`.
- Alerts live in `operator_notification` (severity `info < warning < error < critical`, the 094 CHECK; ranked by
  `priceBudgetNotificationSeverityRank`). ws `pricing.notifications.list` returns the page (`limit`, newest first) plus
  `summary: {open_count, worst_severity|null}` over every OPEN (unacknowledged, unexpired) alert the caller can see,
  from one `GROUP BY vault_id` aggregate (`PriceBudgetService::summarizeOpenNotifications`) filtered by the same vault
  visibility as the rows, so it never depends on `limit` (#172). The console bell reads its badge from it.
- Invariant: never trust unsigned or unverified price artifacts. Estimates are guidance and `fail_open`; enforcement modes act on
  them, so a pricing outage must not wedge sync.

**S3 cost safety** (sync + S3 gateway + remote-only reads)
- Request budgets (LIST/HEAD/GET/PUT/COPY/DELETE/bytes) and price budgets (`off|report|warn|enforce`,
  global/provider/vault) are separate systems. Don't merge them.
- Usage captures (`ScopedS3RequestUsageCapture`) are thread-local and nest: every capture active on the thread is
  checked and records each request (`Controller::recordRequest`), so a hydrate's own cap inside a gateway request
  is still visible to the gateway's capture. `Controller::streamObject` is the metered streaming GET (optional
  signed `Range` and `If-Match`; 412 → `ConditionalRequestFailed`; the GET is metered before it is sent, body
  bytes as they arrive); fakes override the protected `transportGet` seam and keep the metering.
- **Prefer the local ciphertext copy (D11).** Anything that reads a vault file's bytes goes through
  `Engine::openPlaintextReader`: a cloud file with a backing file reads it in place (zero S3 requests). The ws share
  download/preview lanes and the S3 gateway's file reads (`ObjectStore::readFileObject`, ranges read only their
  bytes) do; the HTTP `/download` lane is the lead's rewrite. `CloudEngine::downloadToBuffer/decryptRemotePayload`
  remain only for HTTP `Router.cpp`, rotation, and gateway objects with no `files` row.
- **Remote-only files (`CloudEngine::openMissingReader`, `preview.media.remote`, process default
  `storage::setDefaultRemotePolicy`):**
  - `hydrate` (default): price preflight (`RemoteFetchGate`, default `priceBudgetRemoteFetchGate`: the
    BudgetConservative estimate + `PriceBudgetService::preflight` sync uses, operation `preview_hydrate`; a refusal
    or a failed preflight → `ContentUnavailable`, nothing sent) → per-hydrate request cap (1 HEAD, 1 GET, object
    bytes) → HEAD (ETag, length, `vh-iv`/`vh-key-version`; a length that disagrees with `files.size_bytes` is
    refused, not fetched) → one GET with `If-Match` streamed into an `O_TMPFILE` next to the backing path (named
    0600 `O_EXCL` `.vh-hydrate-*` sibling where unsupported) → `gcmVerifyFd` over the whole message (failure:
    `IntegrityError`, nothing kept) → fsync → if the IV changes (plaintext-upstream objects are sealed on the fly
    under a fresh IV; an encrypted object normally keeps the row's IV, `indexAndDeleteFile` copied it) the files
    row is compare-and-set *first*, then the copy is linked in without replacing anything (`linkat`, EEXIST: a
    writer won) and the directory fsynced. A crash leaves either no copy (re-hydrated next read) or a verified one.
    Concurrent readers of one file share a single fetch (`hydrating_` futures). The reservation is committed with
    the actual usage. The copy stays: the Cache strategy has no eviction yet.
  - `ranged` (opt-in): `RemoteRangedReader`, aligned 4 MiB windows, LRU of 4, every GET `If-Match` the open-time
    ETag (412 → `IntegrityError`), CTR-decrypt with the *remote* IV, per-reader caps (default 2·windows+8 GETs,
    2·(size+window) bytes; past them `ContentUnavailable`), worst case price-reserved at open and actual usage
    committed on close. Positioned reads are **unauthenticated** (a hostile bucket can flip plaintext bits);
    `readAllAuthenticated` fetches the whole object and checks the tag. Chunked AEAD is the eventual fix.
  - `off`: `ContentUnavailable`.
- Dev R2 dogfooding hits a real bucket. With `dev.init_r2_test_vault`, initdb clears the `VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_*` bucket.
